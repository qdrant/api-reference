A collection is a logical grouping for related [points](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/). Each collection can be thought of as a dataset within the database, where you can store, organize, and manage points that share a common purpose or are related in some way.
Each point in a collection consists of one or more vectors with a [payload](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/payload/).

When querying a vector database, you need to specify the collection you want to [search](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search/) within. 

Each Qdrant collection has configurable parameters for optimization, index construction, and vacuum.
